# üîß Current Development Issues

## Overview
This document tracks the main technical challenges currently blocking full automation of the employee schedule synchronization process. The goal is seamless one-click schedule import after MFA verification.

## üéØ Expected Behavior
Users should be able to:
1. Enter username/password credentials
2. Click "Sign In" button  
3. Complete MFA verification when prompted
4. Automatically download 3 weeks of schedule data without further interaction

## üö® Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Form Validation Bypass Problem
**Status**: üî¥ Blocking automation

**Description**: The second password prompt (referred to as "Login Form 2") rejects validation when credentials are populated programmatically, despite accepting the same credentials when entered manually.

**Technical Details**:
- Manual entry via Chrome desktop password manager: ‚úÖ **Works**
- Programmatic population via WebView automation: ‚ùå **Fails validation**
- Manual character deletion/addition after automation: ‚úÖ **Works**
- Programmatic character deletion/addition: ‚ùå **Fails validation**

**Hypothesis**: Corporate portal implements JavaScript-based validation that detects automated input vs. human keyboard events.

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Investigate event simulation differences between manual and automated input
- [ ] Analyze validation JavaScript in corporate portal
- [ ] Test alternative input methods (focus events, key simulation)

### Issue #2: Inconsistent Schedule Import
**Status**: üü° Intermittent failure

**Description**: Schedule import process sometimes retrieves only 2 out of 3 available weekly schedules, with no clear pattern to the failures.

**Observed Behavior**:
- Expected: Import 3 weekly schedules consistently
- Actual: Randomly imports 2-3 schedules per session
- Success rate: ~70-80% for complete import

**Potential Causes**:
- Race conditions in multi-week navigation
- Timing issues with Cognos BI report generation
- Session timeouts during extended import process
- Network latency affecting page load detection

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Add detailed logging to identify which weeks fail to import
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed schedule weeks
- [ ] Optimize timing between week navigation requests
- [ ] Add progress indicators for debugging import flow

## üìù Additional Notes

### Rate Limiting Considerations
The corporate portal may implement rate limiting that affects both issues above. Current automation should respect server response times and implement appropriate delays.

### Testing Environment
Issues are consistently reproducible in:
- Development WebView environment
- iOS Simulator
- Android Emulator
- Physical device testing

### Workarounds
Currently, users can work around these issues by:
1. **Issue #1**: Manually completing the second login form
2. **Issue #2**: Re-running import if fewer than 3 schedules are retrieved
